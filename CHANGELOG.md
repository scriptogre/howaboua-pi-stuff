  - Aligns native OpenAI compaction with Codex v1 by compacting the full active transcript and preserving cached history prefixes during oversized-request trimming.
  - Adds an opt-in Responses compaction v2 protocol that uses the active provider stream and cached WebSocket lifecycle while retaining recent real user messages beside the encrypted checkpoint.

  - GPT-5.6 model windows are conservatively clamped to the current 272k production limit so Pi compacts before backend overflow.
  - Running Code Mode cells and shell commands now identify the exact continuation call needed to resume them in their active tool mode, while repeated Code Mode waits back off locally to give long-running work time to finish.
  - Code Mode also intercepts standalone shell-shaped `apply_patch` calls through the native nested patch tool, matching Codex's lenient invocation path without exposing another top-level schema.

## 1.5.16

- Aligned OpenAI Codex custom-provider cache-affinity headers, timeout handling, reasoning effort options, Bun proxy WebSocket support, and development dependencies with Pi 0.76.

## 1.5.14-1.5.15

- Replaced cached WebSocket request-shape logging with a deterministic continuation-reuse test.

## 1.5.13

- Relaxed native compaction replay parity so the extension preserves the OpenAI compacted window using Pi's current provider payload when persisted session replay shape diverges.

## 1.5.12

## 1.5.11

- Aligned the custom OpenAI Codex provider and Pi development dependencies with Pi 0.75.4.
- Added Codex context-budget alignment so Pi auto-compaction for OpenAI Codex subscription models triggers near Codex's native 90% compacting threshold.

## 1.5.9

## 1.5.8

- Fixed native Responses compaction replay after compaction display messages so requests replace Pi placeholder compaction context with the native compacted window instead of failing parity checks.

## 1.5.7

- Fixed OpenAI Codex custom-provider requests so synthetic `web.run` and `image_generation` adapter tools are rewritten to native Responses tool payloads before sending.
- Fixed subagent and other RPC/no-session Codex runs failing with invalid function tool names when native web search is active.

## 1.5.6

- Added Compaction and Overrides tabs to `/codex`.
- Added optional native Responses compaction for Codex sessions, with settings for compaction model and reasoning.
- Added an `apply_patch`-only override mode for GPT/Codex models. This mode bypasses most of this extension, but still gives you the `apply_patch` tool.
- Renamed the native Codex web search tool from `web_search` to responses-native `web.run`, allowing compatibility with other extensions.
- Synced the custom OpenAI Codex provider and Pi development dependencies with Pi `0.75.3`.

## 1.5.5

- Avoid registering disabled native `web_search` and `image_generation` tools so other extensions can own those names.
- Preserve other extensions' `web_search` and `image_generation` tools when the matching Codex feature is off.
